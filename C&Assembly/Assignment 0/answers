1. helloA.c is  116 bytes,
   helloA.o is 1496 bytes, and
   helloA   is 8632 bytes, for a total of 10244 bytes.

2. helloB.c is  152 bytes,
   helloB.o is 1512 bytes, and
   helloB   is 8632 bytes, for a total of 10296 bytes.
   The output of helloA and helloB are identical.

3. helloC.c is  178 bytes,
   helloC.o is 1648 bytes, and
   helloC   is 8680 bytes, for a total of 10506 bytes.
   The output of helloC is also identical to the outputs of helloA and helloB.

4. helloD.c is  172 bytes,
   helloD.o is 1632 bytes, and
   helloD   is 8632 bytes, for a total of 10436 bytes.
   The output of helloD puts the output of each statement on a separate line, resulting in
   each statement on their own line, including the "\n", and an empty line inherently 
   created by puts().

5. helloE.c is  322 bytes,
   helloE.o is 1784 bytes, and
   helloE   is 8632 bytes, for a total of 10738 bytes.
   The output of helloE is identical to the outputs of helloA, helloB, and helloC.

6. helloA has the smallest source file.

7. helloA has the smallest object file.

8. helloA, helloB, helloD, and helloE all held a tie for the smallest executable file.
